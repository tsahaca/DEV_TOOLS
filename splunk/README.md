## Splunk Regex CheatSheet:
These regular expressions are to be used on characters alone, and the possible usage has been explained in the example 
section on the tabular form below. We will try to be as explanatory as possible to make you understand the usage and 
also the points that need to be noted with the usage.

| **Character** | **Meaning**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| +             | This character when used along with any character, matches with 1 or more occurrences of the previous character used in the regular expression.Example: Splunk+ matches with &ldquo;Splunk&rdquo; or &ldquo;Splunkkk&rdquo; but not with &ldquo;Splun&rdquo;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| \        | This character is used to escape any special character that may be used in the regular expression.Example: Splunk? matches with the string &ldquo;Splunk?&rdquo;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| .             | This character matches with any possible character, as it is always used as a wildcard character.Example: Splunk* matches with &ldquo;Splunk&rdquo;, &ldquo;Splunkster&rdquo; or &ldquo;Splunks&rdquo;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| [ ]           | The open and closed square brackets always match with a range of characters (alphabets, numbers)Example:[sp]lain matches &ldquo;splain&rdquo;, &ldquo;plain&rdquo;[0-9]+ matches to any of the positive integers available in the string where the regular expression will be applied.[a-z] matches to all ASCII letters ranging amongst a to z, but just the lower case letters[A-Z] matches to all ASCII letters ranging amongst A to Z, but just the upper case letters[^0-9] matches to any character but not any positive integers ranging from 0 to 9.                                                                                           |
| |             | This matches with the previous OR next character / group(Ch) | (ch) pra matches to &ldquo;Chopra&rdquo; or &ldquo;chopra&rdquo;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| { }           | This matches the specified regular expression only a specified number of times / occurrences as provided within the flower brackets previously.Example:[0-9]{5} matches to &ldquo;12345&rdquo; or &ldquo;54321&rdquo; but not to &ldquo;12&rdquo; or &ldquo;23&rdquo; or &ldquo;345&rdquo;.[a-z]{1,5} matches to &ldquo;a&rdquo;, &ldquo;ab&rdquo;, &ldquo;abc&rdquo;, &ldquo;abcd&rdquo; and &ldquo;abcde&rdquo; but doesn&rsquo;t exceed more than 5 occurrences as provided in the example.[A-Z]{1,} matches to a string format in capitals as like &ldquo;AXODLFKJERLJ&hellip;&rdquo; as there is no end limit mentioned in the regular expression |
| ^             | This matches the beginning of a provided string or within a character range as provided within the square brackets.Example: [^0-9] matches to any character but not any positive integers ranging from 0 to 9.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| $             | This matches with the end of a provided string.Example: ing$&nbsp;matches with "amazing" but not "ingredient"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |


This section of regular expressions is very specifically dedicated to the Character Classes as such and hence there may or may not be sufficient examples to portray its complete usage.
