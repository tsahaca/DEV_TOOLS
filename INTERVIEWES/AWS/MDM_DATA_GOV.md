Creating a solution architecture for Master Data Management (MDM) and Data Governance using AWS services involves several components that together ensure the management, quality, and security of master data across the organization. Below is a high-level architecture design:

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Data Sources:**
   - On-premises databases, SaaS applications, external data sources, etc.
   - AWS Data Migration Service (DMS) can be used to migrate on-premises data to AWS.

2. **Data Ingestion:**
   - **AWS Glue:** For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, AWS Glue can be used to extract data from various sources, transform it, and load it into data stores.
   - **AWS Lambda:** For serverless data processing and transformation.
   - **Amazon Kinesis:** For real-time data streaming and processing.

3. **Data Storage:**
   - **Amazon S3:** Centralized storage for raw and processed data.
   - **Amazon Redshift:** Data warehousing for structured and semi-structured data.
   - **Amazon RDS/Aurora:** Relational databases for transactional data.
   - **Amazon DynamoDB:** NoSQL database for high-velocity, low-latency data storage.

4. **Data Quality and MDM:**
   - **AWS Glue DataBrew:** For data preparation and ensuring data quality through visual data preparation.
   - **AWS Glue Catalog:** Centralized metadata repository to manage and track data.
   - **Custom MDM Services:** Deployed on Amazon ECS or AWS Lambda to maintain master data records, deduplicate, and manage data consistency.

5. **Data Governance:**
   - **AWS Lake Formation:** To set up, secure, and manage data lakes. It also helps in managing access control and data lineage.
   - **AWS IAM:** For fine-grained access control and identity management.
   - **AWS CloudTrail:** For auditing and logging API activities.
   - **Amazon Macie:** For data privacy and security, ensuring sensitive data is properly managed.
   - **AWS Config:** For resource configuration and compliance management.

6. **Data Cataloging and Discovery:**
   - **AWS Glue Data Catalog:** Centralized metadata repository to track data location, schema, and lineage.
   - **Amazon Athena:** To query and analyze data directly from Amazon S3 using standard SQL.

7. **Data Analytics and Visualization:**
   - **Amazon QuickSight:** For data visualization and business intelligence.
   - **Amazon SageMaker:** For building, training, and deploying machine learning models.

8. **Data Integration:**
   - **AWS Step Functions:** For orchestrating data workflows.
   - **Amazon API Gateway:** To expose APIs for data access and integration with other systems.
