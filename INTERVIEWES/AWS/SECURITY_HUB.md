AWS Security Hub aggregates, organizes, and prioritizes security alerts and findings from multiple AWS services, partner security solutions, and custom security checks. The primary inputs to AWS Security Hub include:

### AWS Service Integrations
These services provide security-related information and findings that Security Hub can aggregate and analyze:

1. **Amazon GuardDuty**:
   - Provides intelligent threat detection for AWS accounts and workloads.
   
2. **Amazon Inspector**:
   - Assesses applications for exposure, vulnerabilities, and deviations from best practices.
   
3. **Amazon Macie**:
   - Discovers and protects sensitive data using machine learning.
   
4. **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer**:
   - Identifies resources shared with an external entity.
   
5. **AWS Firewall Manager**:
   - Manages firewall rules and policies across multiple accounts.
   
6. **AWS Config**:
   - Assesses, audits, and evaluates the configurations of AWS resources.
   
7. **AWS Systems Manager**:
   - Provides operational insights into the AWS environment.

### Partner Integrations
Security Hub supports various third-party security solutions that can send findings to it. Examples include:

1. **CrowdStrike Falcon**:
   - Provides endpoint protection and threat intelligence.
   
2. **Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud**:
   - Offers cloud security posture management and workload protection.
   
3. **Check Point CloudGuard**:
   - Ensures security and compliance for cloud environments.
   
4. **Splunk**:
   - Integrates with Security Hub to correlate findings with logs and other security data.
   
5. **Trend Micro Cloud One**:
   - Provides security for cloud workloads, containers, and applications.

### Custom Integrations
Organizations can also create custom integrations to send findings to Security Hub:

1. **Custom Security Checks**:
   - Custom security checks and rules can be defined and their results sent to Security Hub.
   
2. **AWS Lambda**:
   - Custom Lambda functions can be used to process security events and send findings to Security Hub.
   
3. **Amazon CloudWatch Events**:
   - CloudWatch Events can be used to detect specific activities or changes in the AWS environment and send relevant information to Security Hub.

### Manual Inputs
- **Security Findings**:
   - Administrators can manually input security findings and alerts into Security Hub for aggregation and analysis.
