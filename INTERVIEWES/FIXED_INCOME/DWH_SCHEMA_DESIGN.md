### Implementation Considerations

1. **ETL Processes**: Design ETL processes to extract data from source systems, transform it into the appropriate format, and load it into the data warehouse. Ensure data quality and consistency.
2. **Data Refresh**: Establish data refresh schedules (e.g., daily, weekly) to keep the data warehouse up-to-date.
3. **Indexing and Partitioning**: Implement indexing and partitioning strategies to enhance query performance.
4. **Data Security**: Apply access controls, encryption,
