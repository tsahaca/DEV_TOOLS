Government bonds are debt securities issued by a government to support government spending and obligations. They are generally considered low-risk investments because they are backed by the government's credit. Different types of government bonds vary by their issuing entity, maturity, and specific features. Here are the main types:

### 1. **Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)**
- **Issuer:** U.S. federal government
- **Maturity:** Long-term, typically 20 to 30 years
- **Interest:** Pays semi-annual interest
- **Characteristics:** Considered one of the safest investments since they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.

### 2. **Treasury Notes (T-Notes)**
- **Issuer:** U.S. federal government
- **Maturity:** Medium-term, ranging from 2 to 10 years
- **Interest:** Pays semi-annual interest
- **Characteristics:** Less risky than corporate bonds and offers a balance between short-term T-bills and long-term T-bonds.

### 3. **Treasury Bills (T-Bills)**
- **Issuer:** U.S. federal government
- **Maturity:** Short-term, ranging from a few days to one year
- **Interest:** Sold at a discount and pays face value at maturity (zero-coupon bond)
- **Characteristics:** Very liquid and considered extremely safe; often used by investors for short-term cash management.

### 4. **Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)**
- **Issuer:** U.S. federal government
- **Maturity:** Typically 5, 10, and 30 years
- **Interest:** Pays semi-annual interest; principal is adjusted based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- **Characteristics:** Protects investors against inflation; the principal increases with inflation and decreases with deflation.

### 5. **Savings Bonds**

- **Types:** Series EE and Series I
  - **Series EE Bonds:** Sold at face value, earn a fixed rate of interest, and mature after 30 years.
  - **Series I Bonds:** Include an inflation component that adjusts semi-annually with inflation.
- **Characteristics:** Non-marketable, meaning they cannot be sold in the secondary market; suitable for long-term savings.

### 6. **Municipal Bonds (Munis)**
- **Issuer:** State, city, or local governments
- **Maturity:** Varies, can be short-term or long-term
- **Interest:** Pays periodic interest; often exempt from federal income tax and sometimes state and local taxes

### 7. **Foreign Sovereign Bonds**

### 8. **Agency Bonds**
- **Issuer:** Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) and federal agencies (e.g., Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and the Federal Home Loan Bank)
- **Maturity:** Varies
- **Interest:** Pays periodic interest
- **Characteristics:** Often offers higher yields than Treasury securities due to slightly higher risk; used to support specific sectors like housing.

### Conclusion
Government bonds come in various forms, each tailored to different investor needs and objectives. From short-term T-bills to long-term T-bonds, inflation-protected TIPS, and tax-advantaged municipal bonds, investors have a range of options to choose from, depending on their risk tolerance, investment horizon, and income needs.
