Scrum ceremonies, also known as Scrum events, are structured meetings in the Scrum framework that help teams manage their work efficiently and transparently. Here are the key Scrum ceremonies:
### Common Events in all
The one common activity that happens in all Scrum events is inspection and adaptation. This is a core principle of Scrum and is embedded in each of the Scrum ceremonies to ensure continuous improvement and alignment with goals. Here's how inspection and adaptation manifest in each Scrum event:


1. **Sprint Planning:**
   - **Purpose:** To plan the work to be done during the upcoming sprint.
   - **Participants:** Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team.
   - **Activities:**
     - The Product Owner presents the highest priority items from the Product Backlog.
     - The team discusses and clarifies the items to ensure a common understanding.
     - The Development Team selects the items they commit to completing in the sprint, forming the Sprint Backlog.
     - The team defines a Sprint Goal that describes the purpose of the sprint.

2. **Daily Scrum (Stand-up):**
   - **Purpose:** To synchronize the team's activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.
   - **Participants:** Development Team, Scrum Master (optional), Product Owner (optional).
   - **Activities:**
     - Each team member answers three questions:
       1. What did I do yesterday that helped the team meet the Sprint Goal?
       2. What will I do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal?
       3. Do I see any impediments that prevent me or the team from meeting the Sprint Goal?
     - The meeting is time-boxed to 15 minutes and is usually held at the same time and place each day.

3. **Sprint Review:**
   - **Purpose:** To inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed.
   - **Participants:** Scrum Team, Stakeholders.
   - **Activities:**
     - The Development Team demonstrates the work that has been done during the sprint.
     - The Product Owner discusses the current state of the Product Backlog and potential release dates.
     - The team and stakeholders discuss what has been accomplished and what needs improvement.
     - Feedback is collected from stakeholders to guide future development.

4. **Sprint Retrospective:**
   - **Purpose:** To reflect on the past sprint and identify improvements for future sprints.
   - **Participants:** Scrum Team.
   - **Activities:**
     - The team discusses what went well during the sprint, what didnâ€™t go well, and what could be improved.
     - The team identifies actionable steps to implement in the next sprint to enhance processes and collaboration.
     - The meeting is time-boxed, typically lasting 1.5 to 3 hours for a one-month sprint.

5. **Backlog Refinement (Grooming):**
   - **Purpose:** To keep the Product Backlog updated and ensure that it contains the right items, in the right priority, and at the right level of detail.
   - **Participants:** Product Owner, Development Team, Scrum Master (optional).
   - **Activities:**
     - The Product Owner presents new backlog items and clarifies existing items.
     - The Development Team discusses and provides estimates for the items.
     - The team breaks down large items into smaller, more manageable pieces.
     - This is an ongoing process and not a formal event, typically taking up about 10% of the team's time.

### Summary

Scrum ceremonies facilitate collaboration, transparency, and continuous improvement within the team. By adhering to these structured events, Scrum teams can better manage their work, address challenges promptly, and continuously enhance their processes and product quality.
