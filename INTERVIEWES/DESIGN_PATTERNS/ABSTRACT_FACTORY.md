In Spring Boot, there isn't a direct implementation of the Abstract Factory Method design pattern as a standalone feature. However, Spring's dependency injection and bean management capabilities allow you to implement the Abstract Factory pattern effectively. The framework’s flexibility with annotations and configurations makes it easier to create factories for families of related objects.

Here’s how you can implement the Abstract Factory Method design pattern in Spring Boot:

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Define Abstract Products:**
   Create interfaces for the products you want to generate.

2. **Create Concrete Products:**
   Implement the interfaces for the concrete products.

3. **Define Abstract Factory:**
   Create an interface for the factory that will create families of related products.

4. **Create Concrete Factories:**
   Implement the factory interface to create instances of concrete products.

5. **Configure Spring Beans:**
   Use Spring annotations to define beans for the concrete factories.

### Example Implementation

#### 1. Define Abstract Products

```java
public interface Car {
    void assemble();
}

public interface Truck {
    void assemble();
}
```

#### 2. Create Concrete Products

```java
public class Sedan implements Car {
    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        System.out.println("Assembling a sedan car.");
    }
}

public class PickupTruck implements Truck {
    @Override
    public void assemble() {
        System.out.println("Assembling a pickup truck.");
    }
}
```

#### 3. Define Abstract Factory

```java
public interface VehicleFactory {
    Car createCar();
    Truck createTruck();
}
```

#### 4. Create Concrete Factories

```java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class EconomyVehicleFactory implements VehicleFactory {
    @Override
    public Car createCar() {
        return new Sedan();
    }

    @Override
    public Truck createTruck() {
        return new PickupTruck();
    }
}

@Component
public class LuxuryVehicleFactory implements VehicleFactory {
    @Override
    public Car createCar() {
        return new Sedan(); // This would be a different luxury car in a real scenario
    }

    @Override
    public Truck createTruck() {
        return new PickupTruck(); // This would be a different luxury truck in a real scenario
    }
}
```

#### 5. Configure Spring Beans

With Spring Boot, components are automatically detected and registered as beans thanks to the `@Component` annotation. 

#### 6. Use the Abstract Factory in a Service

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class VehicleAssemblyService {

    private final VehicleFactory vehicleFactory;

    @Autowired
    public VehicleAssemblyService(VehicleFactory vehicleFactory) {
        this.vehicleFactory = vehicleFactory;
    }

    public void assembleVehicles() {
        Car car = vehicleFactory.createCar();
        Truck truck = vehicleFactory.createTruck();
        car.assemble();
        truck.assemble();
    }
}
```

#### 7. Application Configuration

You can specify which factory to use through configuration properties, profiles, or direct injection.

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.boot.CommandLineRunner;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;

@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    CommandLineRunner runner(VehicleAssemblyService vehicleAssemblyService) {
        return args -> vehicleAssemblyService.assembleVehicles();
    }
}
```

### Summary

In this implementation:

- **Abstract Products:** `Car` and `Truck` interfaces.
- **Concrete Products:** `Sedan` and `PickupTruck` classes implementing `Car` and `Truck`.
- **Abstract Factory:** `VehicleFactory` interface with methods to create cars and trucks.
- **Concrete Factories:** `EconomyVehicleFactory` and `LuxuryVehicleFactory` implementing `VehicleFactory`.
- **Service Layer:** `VehicleAssemblyService` uses the factory to create and assemble vehicles.

Spring Boot's dependency injection makes it straightforward to manage the dependencies and lifecycle of the factories and products, effectively supporting the Abstract Factory design pattern.
