# IntelliJ IDEA Settings

## Change the boot Java runtime of the IDE

```bash
Switch the Java runtime used to run IntelliJ IDEA
From the main menu, select Help | Find Action or press Ctrl+Shift+A.

Find and select the Choose Boot Java Runtime for the IDE action.

Select the new desired runtime and click OK.

If necessary, you can change the location where IntelliJ IDEA will download the selected runtime.

Wait for IntelliJ IDEA to restart with the new runtime.

When you open the Choose Boot Runtime for the IDE dialog for the first time, it may take a while to load the 
list of JetBrains Runtime builds from the server.
```
